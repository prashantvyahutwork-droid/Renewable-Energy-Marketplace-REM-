# BIJLI.GRID - Decentralized Energy Marketplace

BIJLI.GRID is a futuristic, decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading platform. It allows users to trade energy directly with one another through a secured, blockchain-integrated interface.

## 🚀 Vision
Built for the future of energy, BIJLI.GRID provides a transparent and immutable ledger for energy transactions, utilizing a high-end holographic/cyberpunk interface to visualize grid topology and peer connections.

## ✨ Key Features
- **P2P Marketplace**: Accept and fulfill energy requests from other peers (e.g., Rajesh, Priya).
- **Identity Portal**: Secure authentication system (Email/Password) and Web3 wallet integration (Balance, Chain ID).
- **Global Peer Topology**: 3D visualization of the energy grid and regional hubs (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore).
- **Grid Ledger**: Real-time transaction tracking categorized by energy source (Solar, Wind, Fusion, etc.).
- **Smart Preferences**: Control grid auto-sync, energy alerts, and route optimization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Three.js, @react-three/fiber, Framer Motion
- **Blockchain**: Ethers.js (Web3 integration)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
